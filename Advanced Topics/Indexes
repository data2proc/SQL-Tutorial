The Concept of Index in SQL and Related Points:

In this article, we discuss the types of indexes, how to create and manage them, and provide a general explanation of their functionality.

An index is similar to a table of contents in books. It helps direct you to the data or information you are looking for. Imagine if your book didn’t have a table of contents—finding any topic would require searching through the book from beginning to end or vice versa. Naturally, this process would be highly error-prone and time-consuming. When you look for a specific record in SQL Server without defining a specific index on the table, SQL Server searches record by record (similar to page by page in a book) to find the required data. By defining the correct index on database tables, the process of searching for records and fields becomes easier.

An index is essentially an object in the database that allows you to find specific data in a table faster. Like a book's table of contents, it occupies some space, but given its advantages, this space usage is worthwhile. You don’t need to remind SQL Server to use the created index; it will automatically use it if the query is written in a way that matches the index. Whether you are a database administrator or a software developer, knowing about indexes is highly useful and efficient for both roles.
